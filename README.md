# Argh-steroids

Asteroids-like game using pygame. 

Install [pygame](http://pygame.org) and run `main.py`.

# Features

* Asteroids bump off each other. It uses a map to make collision detection
  fast.

* Your ship has a shield and you can bump into asteroids a few times. The
  shield regenerates slowly.

* Mouse and keyboard controls.

* Vector graphics using an affine transform rather than a lot of trig
  functions. 

* It's fine on a Raspberry-Pi, for example. On my modest 
  laptop it can animate >300 asteroids at 60 fps.
